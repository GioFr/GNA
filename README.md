# GNA
In this notebook I explore Generative Adversarial Networks (GNA). As for a training data MNIST's fashion dataset is used to train the model in unsupervided manner in order to generate the fake images which look like the real ones. The architecture of GNA model consists of two major blocks - generator and discriminator, which compete in an ersatz game where one's gain is another's loss. The generator generates a random data which is fed to discriminator whose job is to differentiate the fake data from an original data. The result is then backpropagated to generator which tries to minimiwe the error in order to fool the discriminator into believing that it is a real data.
